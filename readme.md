#Responsive 'Rainbow' Tables
This tidy bit of CSS will adapt a standard table to a usable, scrollable format at whichever content width you set in the media query.

##Goals
This solution is 100% CSS and does not hide any information. It can be dropped into your stylesheet and will work with only minor tweaks (if you have customized how tables appear on your site, you may have to override them). It aims to be usable by clearly delineating table cells with color and rows with color and spacing. The colors should be accessible for people with color deficiencies by alternating foreground/background contrast.
